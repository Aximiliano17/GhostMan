# GhostMan
A game like Pac Man, but the inverse, where you control the Ghost and follow the PacMen. You need to try and eat the yellow Pacmen as
fast as you can, before they eat as many dots as they can. The more dots they eat the less your score. The red Pacman will try and eat you
while you are trying to eat the yellow Pacmen. The red Pacman will convert to a normal yellow Pacman, after you eat all the normal yellow Pacs.
