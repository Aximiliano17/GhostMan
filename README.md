# GhostMan
-A game like Pac Man, but the inverse, where you control the Ghost and follow the PacMen.
-You need to try and eat the yellow Pacmen as fast as you can, before they eat as many dots as they can. The more dots they eat the less your score.It is possible to get a lower score even if you make it into another level, based on how many dots the pacmen have eaten.
-Only 3 levels were implemented.
-The red Pacman will try and eat you while you are trying to eat the yellow Pacmen. You ca only eat the red pacman, once you have eaten all the other regular pacmen.
