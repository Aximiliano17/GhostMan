The Game is the inverse of Pacman, where the user controls the ghost and attempts to eat the Pacs before they eat the dots.
Since the game seemed too simplistic, I implemented a red Pac that can eat the Ghost. The Red Pac becomes a normal Pac when the other Pacs have been dealt with.
If the Ghost gets eaten is game over. The user gets points for every dot left int he map after the map has been cleared. Only 3 maps were implemented.
